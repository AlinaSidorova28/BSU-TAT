Don’t bury me
Don’t let me down
Don’t say it’s over
‘Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don’t say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

I die everytime you walk away
Don’t leave me alone with me
See, I’m afraid
Of the darkness and my demons
And the voices, say nothing’s gonna be okay, heeyyy
I feel it in my heart, soul,
mind that I’m losing
You, me, you’re abusing
Every reason that I’ve left to live.

Don’t bury me
Don’t let me down
Don’t say it’s over
‘Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don’t say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under
